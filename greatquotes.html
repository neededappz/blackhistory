The majority of the Negroes who took part in the year-long boycott of Montgomery's buses were poor and untutored; but they understood the essence of the Montgomery movement; one elderly woman summed it up for the rest.

Martin Luther King, Jr.
</li>
<li>
59. Even when the polls are open to all, Negroes have shown themselves too slow to exercise their voting privileges.

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
62. There is such a thing as the freedom of exhaustion.

</li>
<li>
67. As long as the colored man look to white folks to put the crown on what he say...as long as he looks to white folks for approval...then he ain't never gonna find out who he is and what he's about.
August Wilson, Jr.

69. It is a civilization naturally backward because it is different? Outside of cannibalism, which can be matched in this country, at least, by lynching, there is no vice and no degradation in native African customs which can begin to touch the horrors thrust upon them by white masters. Drunkenness, terrible diseases, immortality, all of these have been gifts of European civilization.
W.E.B. Dubois
</li>
<li>
70. Enslave the liberty of but one human being and the liberties of the world are put in peril.
William Lloyd Garrison
</li>

71. The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he any color of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box. As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it - whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, no matter how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash.
Harper Lee
</li>
<li>

73. I will always remember my delight when Mrs. Georgia Gilmore - an unlettered woman of unusual intelligence - told how an operator demanded that she get off the bus after paying her fare and board it again by the back door, and then drove away before she could get there. She turned to Judge Carter and said: 'When they count the money, they do not know Negro money from white money.'
Martin Luther King, Jr.
</li>
<li>
74. We did not hesitate to call our movement an army. But it was a special army, with no supplies but its sincerity, no uniform but its determination, no arsenal except its faith, no currency but its conscience.
Martin Luther King, Jr.
</li>
<li>
75. The problem with hatred and violence is that they intensity the fears of the white majority, and leave them less ashamed of their prejudices toward Negroes.
Martin Luther King, Jr.
